        <p>Edlo is a modified version of Stephen G. Hartke's <a href="http://www.dafont.com/aurulent-sans-mono.font">Aurulent Sans</a>, which I thought was beautiful, but hazardous for programming because the similarities between zeroes and ohs and ones and els were too close for comfort.</p>

<p>Edlo is the marriage of these edits and Mr. Hartke's original vision. The zero now has a dot in the middle of it, and the lowercase el has its left leg chopped off, making all of these characters unique.</p>
