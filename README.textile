h1. About Edlo

h3. Version 1.00

Edlo is a customized version of Stephen G. Hartke's 
"Aurulent Sans":http://www.dafont.com/aurulent-sans-mono.font.


In Snow Leopard, Monaco is my usual default font. 
I really like it but it's a little too close to Comic Sans, which I 
just can't take seriously.

v1.0

Added a dotted zero version of Meslo LG which is called Meslo LG DZ.
